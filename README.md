## Contributing Your Game to Realms World

Welcome developers! We'd love to feature your game on the Realms World site. Follow this guide to add your game to our showcase.

### Prerequisites

- Your game should be built on or integrated with the Realms ecosystem
- Have all required assets ready (images, screenshots)
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/realms-world-site.git
cd realms-world-site
```

#### 2. Add Your Game Assets

Create a folder for your game in `public/games/` with your game's slug name:

```bash
mkdir -p public/games/your-game-name/screenshots
```

Add the following assets:

- `cover.png` or `cover.webp` - Your game's cover image (recommended: 16:9 aspect ratio)
- `screenshots/` folder - Add numbered screenshots (1.png, 2.png, etc.)

#### 3. Update the Games Data File

Edit `src/data/games.ts` to add your game information:

```typescript
{
  id: 14, // Use the next available ID
  slug: "your-game-slug", // URL-friendly name (lowercase, hyphens)
  title: "Your Game Title",
  image: "/games/your-game-slug/cover.png",
  backgroundImage: "/games/your-game-slug/cover.png",
  backgroundImages: [
    "/games/your-game-slug/screenshots/1.png",
    "/games/your-game-slug/screenshots/2.png",
    // Add more screenshots as needed
  ],
  genre: ["Genre1", "Genre2"], // e.g., ["Strategy", "PvP", "RPG"]
  description: "A compelling description of your game...",
  status: "development", // Options: "mainnet" | "testnet" | "development"
  isLive: true, // Is the game currently playable?
  studio: "Your Studio Name",

  // Optional fields:
  players: 1000, // Current player count
  tvl: 500000, // Total Value Locked in USD
  whitepaper: "https://your-whitepaper-url.com",
  video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID", // YouTube embed URL
