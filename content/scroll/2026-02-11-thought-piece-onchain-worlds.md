Most games are shipped as closed products. Onchain worlds work better when they are treated as public systems.

## Durable Design Principles

### 1) Legibility beats magic

Players and contributors should be able to understand how key systems work without reading private code or hidden spreadsheets.

### 2) Forkability is a feature

If a game system is truly open, other teams can adapt it. That does not weaken the original world. It increases total surface area for innovation.

### 3) Coordination is gameplay

When economies and governance are real, social coordination becomes part of the game itself.

## Closing

The long-term winners in onchain gaming will not be the teams that hide the most implementation details. They will be the teams that make world logic clear enough for others to extend.
