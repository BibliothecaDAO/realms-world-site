This week was defined by one thing: velocity.

Studios pushed new playable loops, contributors landed infra improvements, and community operators helped tighten feedback cycles between players and builders.

## Highlights

- More teams moved from prototype screens into gameplay-heavy test builds.
- Shared infra matured, reducing repeated setup work for new projects.
- Community QA participation increased, especially around onboarding and progression.

## Why This Matters

Every small ship compounds. The network effect is not only players joining games, it is developers learning from each other in public and compressing the distance between idea and playable product.

The Scroll will keep tracking these moments so the ecosystem has a consistent record of progress.
